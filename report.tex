\section{Overview}
The Variational Parser or whatever it's called now is a tool supporting C preprocessor-like language extensions. The intended use case for this parser is to support an Atom editor plugin enabling users to inspect and modify documents containing the equivalent to \#ifdefs by specifying whether dimensions are defined, and if so, whether to choose between a "left" or "right" alternative.

What we're delivering enables users to do two basic actions:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Parse a document containing our variational syntax into an abstract syntax tree with line and column numbers that support syntax highlighting.
\item Consume an AST and a set of user selections, producing an AST with the specified dimensions reduced to one of their branches. (the "view" function).
\end{enumerate}
Some of the work done by this parser is already done by the C preprocessor, and the tool bears a vague resemblance to some commonly-used "language service" programs that support editor plugins that maximize the amount of code that can be shared between plugin implementations for various different editors.
